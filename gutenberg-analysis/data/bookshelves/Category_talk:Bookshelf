<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Modus_Operandi">Modus Operandi</span></h2>
<p>Some rules I put up to discussion:
</p><p>1) I don't think anybody should "own" a bookshelf. If you care about a topic, then put some work into it. But don't fend off other people who might have the same interests.
</p><p>2) A bookshelf should offer more than just an alphabetical or chronological list of works. Add comments, links and cross references whenever you think it appropriate.
</p><p>2) If you elect a book to be "Editor's Choice" or just give it some stars, make sure it isn't just one of your pet books, but make sure the book has the quality to stand up before a wide and disparate audience. <a href="/wiki/User:Marcello" title="User:Marcello">highlander</a> 11:42, 8 December 2006 (EST)
</p><p><br />
to 1) I do not intend to own SF. I was just not yet able to get others interested (i tried in Baen's Bar). Hallvard Furuseth has joined so this is no problem anymore for SF.
</p><p>to 2) Already working on it.
</p><p>to 3) No problem with my choice (i hope).
</p><p><a href="/wiki/User:Robert_Marquardt" title="User:Robert Marquardt">Robert Marquardt</a> 11:55, 8 December 2006 (EST)
</p><p>For now i have added my name in the box title (mainly an experiment). I think a single box with the name(s) added in the content area looks better (i tried multiple boxes). <a href="/wiki/User:Robert_Marquardt" title="User:Robert Marquardt">Robert Marquardt</a> 11:55, 8 December 2006 (EST)

<dl><dd> We can put multiple editor names into a single box ... (use ~~~ as shortcut to add your name). What do the other people think? <a href="/wiki/User:Marcello" title="User:Marcello">highlander</a> 13:09, 8 December 2006 (EST)</dd></dl>
<p>Multiple boxes may be needed. I just added a Reader's Choice box to the Christmas section. We will probably also need the stars in different colors. <a href="/wiki/User:Robert_Marquardt" title="User:Robert Marquardt">Robert Marquardt</a> 09:40, 9 December 2006 (EST)

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="My_ideas_for_organizing_the_Bookshelf_tree">My ideas for organizing the Bookshelf tree</span></h2>
<p>First lets talk about what the Bookshelf should be. It should provide fast and structured access to the books of PG. A tree of index pages is the obvious choice. The tree should be not too deep.</p>
<p>Now structured access means several possible structures. The first choice is structure by genre. This is what we currently have. Other structures can be added later.</p>
<p>The most basic structure for the books is fiction and non-fiction. My proposal is to separate this into two trees, ie two links on the main page for a "Fiction Bookshelf" and a "Non-Fiction Bookshelf". An index page containing only links to these wo category would make the tree too deep and would not be visually pleasing because only two links is a bleak and empty page suggesting that the following pages are equally bleak and empty.</p>
<p>For the pages of Fiction we have two different structurings. Inclusive and exclusive. That is a Crime section would contain all the books of the sub-genres and sub-sections of Detective and Mystery. Exclusive structuring for the SF section where i want to put the pre-Verne books on a deeper level of the tree. This will allow books as early as possible in the tree while banning the less interesting/popular works down the tree. All in all we will have three kinds of pages. Links-only pages, -and-content pages and content-only pages.</p>
<p>The root page of Fiction should carry not too many categories so we should carefully choose them. We should also add several empty categories like Horror etc to attract co-workers to fill them in. For the visual layout i think we should follow the <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.delphi-jedi.org/">http://www.delphi-jedi.org/</a> design. It is visually rich and pleasing which is an important factor for ease of use. I have already asked if we can get the nice round picture frame and maybe help in creating the icons (i am member of Project Jedi). I got an answer already with all we need to create our own icons.</p>
<p>Maybe i will find time tomorrow to set up a rough design in my sandbox.</p>

<dl><dd>Don't forget Poetry. <a href="/wiki/User:Ricdiogo" title="User:Ricdiogo">Ricdiogo</a> 12:52, 9 December 2006 (EST)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> 1) Real estate on the sidebar is limited, so don't count on putting many links there.</dd>
<dd> 2) I think fiction and non-fiction are quite useless categories because they are already implicated in many categories, like Crime Fiction, Science Fiction, Fantasy. Nobody would look for a non-fiction book in category: Fantasy.</dd>
<dd> 3) Categories allow for more diverse than just tree structures. One category can be a child of many parents. Like "England -- Social life and customs -- 19th century -- Fiction" can be a child of "social life" "British Literature" and "19th century Literature".</dd>
<dd> 4) The wikipedia policy for categories is that an entry should not be listed in a category <i>and</i> a sub-category thereof. So detective fiction books would not be listed again under crime fiction. I vote to follow wikipedia policies when there is no very good reason to do otherwise. Of course the same book can be listed in many unrelated categories.</dd>
<dd> 5) Make sure you use only GPLed or better icons. Also, the icon idea works well for some categories, like the deerstalker for detective fiction, but what icon could we use for 18th century British social drama? <a href="/wiki/User:Marcello" title="User:Marcello">Marcello</a> 13:55, 9 December 2006 (EST)</dd></dl>
<p><br />
</p>
<dl><dd> 1) I thought long about real estate vs an index page and in this case (if we implement it, see 2) the links won. If we place all Fiction and Non-Fiction links on a single page we get too many links and the page is not easily navigable anymore.</dd>
<dd> 2) I object. Fiction and Non-Fiction separates the users into readers for leisure and readers for work (more or less). It makes the pages easier to navigate by reducing the number of links and it allows to drop the word "Fiction" so "Crime Fiction" becomes "Crime". The icon frame could be colored to indicate Fiction vs Non-Fiction which provides information about where you are.</dd>
<dd> 3) This is a tree like a Unix file system. The only limitation would be that no up-links are allowed to avoid endless recursion. A user could otherwise get lost in it.</dd>
<dd> 4) I did not know that. It brings up another problem though. An author can now be spread over several categories. We will then need more categories. I fear that the tree grows too big then to be easily navigable. We are between Scylla and Charibdis though. Lets implement something and see how it works.</dd>
<dd> 5) I intend to create the icons myself so the license is no problem. For too specialized categories a generic Gutenberg icon will be good enough. The main idea is to make the upeer pages of the tree as visually pleasing as possible to attract users.<br /><a href="/wiki/User:Robert_Marquardt" title="User:Robert Marquardt">Robert Marquardt</a> 02:09, 10 December 2006 (EST)</dd></dl>
<p><br />
</p>
<dl><dd> I have created a sample table here: <a href="/wiki/User:Robert_Marquardt" title="User:Robert Marquardt">Robert Marquardt</a>. I have also created a simple generic PG icon and sent it to Marcello (webmaster address).</dd>
<dd> How about creating a "Bookshelf Tree Test Area" link on the Bookshelf page? Each of us can then create his own tree on that page and we can discuss until we settle on a version. The Bookshelf page is continued in the current fashion to allow the work on the content to stay easily accessible.<br /><a href="/wiki/User:Robert_Marquardt" title="User:Robert Marquardt">Robert Marquardt</a> 07:26, 10 December 2006 (EST)</dd></dl>
<p><br />
</p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd> ... Re: Icons - I find icons to be more trouble then they are worth... too busy and detract from the actual content. Text labels are sufficent.</dd>
<dd> ... Re: Fic/Non-Fic - I also feel that there is no need to seperate out Fic from Non-Fic at a top level... there is nothing wrong with having a page with a long category index (as long as it is in alphabetical order)... Seeing <i>Science</i> next to <i>Science Fiction</i> would not likely be confusing ... of course, if the PG books were cataloged properly in the first place, we wouldn't need to bother with bookshelves because we'd be able to perform appropriate searches in the database in the first place. (FYI: I'm a catalog librarian in "real life" =) <a href="/wiki/User:Thistlechick" title="User:Thistlechick">Thistlechick</a> 11:09, 11 December 2006 (EST)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p><br />
</p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd> The icons are for making the page visually attractive and for reducing the number of links to encourage a structured design. I think we will have to implement  more levels of the tree first to see how it works out. I can live without icons, but we will definitely need more structure than alphabetical labels if the number of categories grows. Fic vs Non-Fic seems dead, but something will be needed anyway. This will allow to add other categorizations than by genre on this page. See Online catalog link on the main page for the categorizations by language and by data type. If we mix them up with the genres in an alphabetical list it will become hard to navigate because the user has to unwrap the mixup of categorization classes.</dd>
<dd> The good thing about the Bookshelf is that PG can plunder it to improve the cataloging. The work on it also uncovers errors in the database. In Talk:Science Fiction -&gt; misc questions i have already posted two of them.</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Languages">Languages</span></h2>
<p>I just created <a href="/wiki/Christianity_(Bookshelf)" title="Christianity (Bookshelf)">Christianity (Bookshelf)</a> and added a Danish version of the Bible.  A bit later I noticed that <a href="/wiki/PT_Poesia_(Prateleira)" title="PT Poesia (Prateleira)">PT Poesia (Prateleira)</a> existed.  Should bookshelves be single language? Besides original texts such as an Arabic Qur'an definitely belongs on all language bookshelves since it is a founding work... or so I think.  Comments? Has this been decided? <a href="/wiki/User:Grenavitar" title="User:Grenavitar">Grenavitar</a> 03:01, 29 December 2006 (EST)

<dl><dd> Currently a Bookshelf page carries all books for the category. I think it should stay that way for any language version of PG. Otherwise most of the non-english Bookshelf pages would be empty.<br />BTW i just added a big chunk of bibles. <a href="/wiki/User:Robert_Marquardt" title="User:Robert Marquardt">Robert Marquardt</a> 03:12, 29 December 2006 (EST)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Books can be categorized in both bookshelves (in the main Bookshelf and in the language version.) The Bookshelf can carry <i>all the books</i>, but the language bookshelves can carry only <i>some of</i> the books in that given language. Nothing prevents a language of not having a bookshelf for a given category or having only one book in it. For a Portuguese speaker is easier to find a Port. poetry book in PT Poesia (Prateleira) than in Poetry (Bookshelf).  <a href="/wiki/User:Ricdiogo" title="User:Ricdiogo">Ricdiogo</a> 16:46, 29 December 2006 (EST)</dd></dl>
<p>I would prefer that english books are listed anyway. Most of the languages simply do not have enough books for a bookshelf. This is the decision of the language maintainer though. A link to the english bookshelf page or showing the books in the language first and the english books at the end of the page. It probably depends also on the amount of extra text on the english page. Simple book listings like now can be linked to. Elaborate text could be translated. <a href="/wiki/User:Robert_Marquardt" title="User:Robert Marquardt">Robert Marquardt</a> 00:45, 30 December 2006 (EST)

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Religion_Bookshelf">Religion Bookshelf</span></h2>
<p>I think we should create a "Religion (Bookshelf)" page and put links to the religion pages on it. That would be the first step towards a tree organization of the bookshelf. Also how about using the Wiki subpages feature? <a href="/wiki/User:Robert_Marquardt" title="User:Robert Marquardt">Robert Marquardt</a> 04:14, 4 January 2007 (EST)
</p>
<dl><dd>I had thought of a "Wikipedia-like" organization--but I recall seeing somewhere that someone wanted there not to be many subdirectories because it would make it more difficult to browse.  I have thought for a while now of creating Bookshelf which could be organized into sections.  Religion, Social Sciences, Literature, etc.  It would be simple enough to do and some might appreciate it.</dd>
<dd>Another option would be keeping all bookshelves in <a href="/wiki/Category:Bookshelf" title="Category:Bookshelf">Category:Bookshelf</a> but also adding other categories like Category:Religious Bookshelves.  As of now all bookshelves are only in one category and could easily be in more.  This way people could browse a comprehensive list or a particular list--depending on their fancies.</dd>
<dd>I think using the subpage feature is inadvisable because it doesn't allow for growth.  As of now Christianity would be a subpage of religion and Christmas a subpage of Christianity.  But, in the future as Gutenberg grows let's say we have Category:Holidays bookshelves because we now have dozens of books on Diwali, Passover, Eid.  It can't be a subpage to both even though it is a sub idea of both.  Not that I'm really advocating anything too complex--since the goal seemed to be to keep it simple. <a href="/wiki/User:Grenavitar" title="User:Grenavitar">Grenavitar</a> 06:55, 4 January 2007 (EST)</dd></dl>
<p>How about a limited tree structure for some areas? Religion is such a candidate because it is cleanly structured. The Religion page has the links to the specific religious page and can also carry text about the relation of the religions. <a href="/wiki/User:Robert_Marquardt" title="User:Robert Marquardt">Robert Marquardt</a> 01:45, 6 January 2007 (EST)

<dl><dd>The LoCC records should be plundered. Especially for Christianity there are several entries in "Advanced Search" which lead to works which should added to the Christianity (Bookshelf). Also the LOCC categories for Christianity are a good guide for reorganizing that bookshelf <a href="/wiki/User:Robert_Marquardt" title="User:Robert Marquardt">Robert Marquardt</a> 10:16, 2 February 2007 (EST)</dd></dl>
<p>I notice that in July, the Book of Mormon was removed with a comment that "Mormons are not Christians!!!".  In early December, another LDS related book was removed.  I don't want to start any holy wars here (I'm not Christian nor Mormon and hence have no horse in this race); but, this seems problematic to me.  Mormons do consider themselves Christians. The Wikipedia article from which the intro to the page is taken considers them Christians. Of course, others disagree.
</p><p>If we're going to categorize religions, it seems to me that it would be best to categorize them based on the opinions of the believers of the specific religion in question.
</p><p>Comments?  Other opinions?

My professor told me the other day that he didn't think Catholics were considered Christians--not in a mean, way, but that's what he thought.  But, I am sure we will keep them on the shelf.  Here is my justification for re-adding them.  1) They are a clear offshoot of Christianity 2) they self-identify as Christian and 3) Library of Congress classification lists them as BX which is "Christian Denominations".

<p>Is it possible to have an email (list) address at PG so Bookshelf users can easily send a message via link on the Bookshelf pages?
That would allow to get hints about books to add when the users are too lazy or shy to register and do it themselves.
Spam may become a problem, but then we can simply delete the list and declare the experiment closed. <a href="/wiki/User:Robert_Marquardt" title="User:Robert Marquardt">Robert Marquardt</a> 13:34, 19 January 2007 (EST)

<dl><dd>I'm thinking it might be easier (and better) to allow anonymous users to post only on "user talk" namespace?

It has a cutoff of publication date around 1900, and the book status has not been updated much lately, but it'd be a good starter for a bookshelf page.

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Category:Periodicals_Bookshelf" title="Category:Periodicals Bookshelf">Periodicals Bookshelf</a> shows that it is possible to place text on such index pages. I think we could place such a text on the <a href="/wiki/Category:Bookshelf" title="Category:Bookshelf">Bookshelf</a> page also.<br />
Something like "Featured Bookshelf category of the month: <a href="/wiki/Science_Fiction_(Bookshelf)" title="Science Fiction (Bookshelf)">Science Fiction (Bookshelf)</a>.

<dl><dd>I think that's good.  I would do either one or two things related to that.  Either: 1) have features not on a monthly schedule and choose on a schedule bookshelves to feature but during times like Christmas, or other holidays have them as featured.  Or 2) Have a monthly featured and then have "current bookshelf" but under a more clever name where it links to events that are happening in the real world.  Like <a href="/wiki/Christmas_(Bookshelf)" title="Christmas (Bookshelf)">Christmas (Bookshelf)</a> on Christmas.  <a href="/wiki/Christianity_(Bookshelf)" title="Christianity (Bookshelf)">Christianity (Bookshelf)</a> on Easter.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Holocaust.2C_Precursors_.28Bookshelf.29">Holocaust, Precursors (Bookshelf)</span></h2>
<p>I think this should be discussed.  It seems a little problematic to me because... not all links are clear and we are linking authors (without benefit of explanation) to a genocide.

<dl><dd> Maybe change to "Racism (Bookshelf)" and make Holocaust a section on the page. It would also allow to add the numerous texts about slavery. I think for now we should simply wait and see. <a href="/wiki/Islam_(Bookshelf)" title="Islam (Bookshelf)">Islam (Bookshelf)</a> worked well. I expected flamewars there already. <a href="/wiki/User:Robert_Marquardt" title="User:Robert Marquardt">Robert Marquardt</a> 00:21, 21 January 2007 (EST)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>But Islam is a subject people write about.  You get flame wars discussing Islam--but people won't say that Robert Spencer books aren't about Islam; they'd say they are misinformed.  People didn't write about the Holocaust before 1922... for good reason and I find it a little worrisome to link certain authors to the Holocaust in such a way.  Eugenics was related to the Holocaust, but not all Eugenics is a precursor and I think a lot of people involved in Eugenics would probably have been horrified by the Holocaust.  It's just too much independent viewpoint and research to do that.  Now, if there is a Library of Congress subject marker talking about precursors and he can make it clear that it is being used, then I'd have no problem.  But, these are bookshelves, and we should be using notable classification systems for this--I think.  But, no flamewar... there aren't even enough editors yet&#160;:)  --<a href="/wiki/User:Grenavitar" title="User:Grenavitar">Grenavitar</a> 05:21, 21 January 2007 (EST)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd> This is why i think the page should get a new name and a reorganization. Holocaust as title is too narrow. It belongs to a subsection of Antisemitism.</dd></dl>
<p>Lets wait a day or two for Wikijeff to enter this discussion and if he does not comment then we should do the change ourselves.
The books need comments why they are listed. Darwin should be added because "On the Origin of Species" is the base for some racist theories. <a href="/wiki/User:Robert_Marquardt" title="User:Robert Marquardt">Robert Marquardt</a> 06:36, 21 January 2007 (EST)
</p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd> I don't think that a scientific theory that is true (except in Kentucky) deserves to be mentioned in this category. The bible is the base for many more racist ideas than Darwin's book, so if we put in Darwin we have to also put in the bible, the coran, etc. <a href="/wiki/User:Marcello" title="User:Marcello">Marcello</a> 16:21, 27 January 2007 (EST)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd> I agree that "Racism (Bookshelf)" would be a good way to handle this so that we have larger topics on the category page with subcategories included on the actual bookshelf... allows for less overwhelming browsing. <a href="/wiki/User:Thistlechick" title="User:Thistlechick">Thistlechick</a> 15:00, 24 January 2007 (EST)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Well, even that is slightly problematic.  For most of our non-fiction bookshelves they are about their titles.  Islam (Bookshelf) is books about Islam.  There aren't many books about racism... so would we be classifying books on Racism (Bookshelf) as being racist?  Although, say, Mein Kampf is pretty racist... not all lines are that clear... and it becomes problematic.  I think the Library of Congress is smart because their subject classification for Mein Kampf is merely "Germany--Politics and government--20th century."  I worry that if we get into classifying books as racist or sexist instead of classifying books on those subjects then we will run into problems.  That is my problem with Holocaust precursors.  We are saying "these books helped lead to the Holocaust" instead of what the books are about.  As a reliable subject guide we should say what books are about and avoid the other political questions. There are plenty of sources that will people decide if a book influenced the Holocaust or sexism or racism in America--we don't need to tell people.  But we can point them to books about racism or sexism or the Holocaust.  I think this is of fundamental importance so I'd like to hear if people agree or disagree. <a href="/wiki/User:Grenavitar" title="User:Grenavitar">Grenavitar</a> 15:11, 27 January 2007 (EST)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd> "Racism (Bookshelf)" should contain books about racism. Racist books should go into "Racist Books (Bookshelf)". Next we'll need "Books with Factual Inaccuracies". This is a easy one, just put every book in there and you're done. Just kidding. How are we going to decide if a book is racist or not?

<p>Alright folks, I'll give my two-cents as to why I created this bookshelf, and some explanation as well. Let me start off by saying I thought this bookshelf would be controversial for sure, but I have no intention of making it a personal soap-box. Indeed one of my reasons for doing this was because WWI seems to be well covered but WWII is not (in any obvious way) by PG texts. This has everything to do with the fact that many good, and not so good books on the subject are still copyrighted and nothing more. However, things that lead up to those unfortunate events (in one way or another) are old enough to be in PD, and many are on PG.
</p><p>I wanted to put all of the works that I could find in one place on PG for example: The theory of Evolution led (with some modification by others) rather directly to the idea that some of us are more "evolved" then the rest of us (Eugenics). But also, the Theosophical Society took Hitler under its wing and made him as messianic figure (hence Hitler's obsession with the Occult). There are other things too--religious movements within Christendom perpetuated by the Nazi's, and some play (I forget which one--if someone knows comment) that lead Hitler to kill a close relative (his cousin, I think). No easy way availed it self to tie this complex web of information available (now or in the future) on PG save a bookshelf.
</p><p>For the record, the Holocaust precursor is just a skeleton of major points that hit me at the time. I have every intention--with community support--of writing small bits of information as to what the Theory of Evolution is doing next to the work of an eccentric occultist. And moreover what a Christian religious movement that teaches the Christian "Church" has replaced "Israel" and "the Jews" as God's Chosen People has to do with the rest of it. Because, you are right, in the absence of additional explanation the list is confusing. I just have not had the luxury of the time (due to my work schedule) to put the explanatory matter before each section so the reader has some clue how these subjects connect.
</p><p>If it is possible for the Bookshelf to stay, and be developed (with the necessary amount of commentary) by the community I'd love to see it. I'm open to more discussion on this matter. I hope I've been both clear and reasonable. And thanks to <i>Grenavitar</i> for bringing this conversation to my attention. &#8212;<a href="/wiki/User:Wikijeff" title="User:Wikijeff">Wikijeff</a> 17:16, 27 January 2007 (EST).

<dl><dd>As long as you do not abandon your bookshelf we can wait for the information added. I think renaming it to "Racism (Bookshelf)" is still the way to go.</dd>
<dd>Holocaust can then be added as a category where you can write as much text as you want. I do not mind controversies over the content as long as it is not about text quality or poor organzation.

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd> I see no problem. You can create as many bookshelves as you like. I think we will keep the Racism bookshelf for now and see if it flies (ie if it gets improved). You now know that such a controversial bookshelf needs needs better planning. Best post it in a more mature state than the Racism bookshelf. Alternatively create it as an orphaned page (no links to it and no inclusion in the Bookshelf Category) and write something about your intentions on its talk page. <a href="/wiki/User:Robert_Marquardt" title="User:Robert Marquardt">Robert Marquardt</a> 14:12, 28 January 2007 (EST)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd> After additional thought and reading of these comments, I understand the arguments for each of these solutions... especially the preference for the bookshelf title being ABOUT a topic or genre, and our not making judgements about the content of the books (i.e. Huckleberry Finn is racist? or just a product of the time period?). I'm glad that we can have this discussion without getting hostile to one another (unlike other wiki projects *winks*) ...
